# Initializing the project
Initialize the project using CMake from the command line. Don't forge to add any extra directories that are required in the `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`.

Then, initialize the project in Qt Creator. A new tool kit is required if custom directories were added in the `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`. To create the custom directory, in the left toolbar select consecutively (under welcome):
```
Projects -> Manage Kits... -> Default -> Clone
```
In the `Initial CMake parameters` append the required paths to the `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`.

Now the project is ready to be configured. During the configuration phase, do not forge to redirect the output of each configuration to the appropriate directory which has been generated by running the CMake from the command line.
